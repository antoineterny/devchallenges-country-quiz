<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-country-quiz.netlify.app/)

At first glance I thought this project was about API requests, in fact it was much more about game logic.
If I had to do it again it would be much different, now that I have the big picture.   
Anyway I had fun playing with this game so I build a configuration page to make it challenging and learn new things about the world, hope it will be the same for you!
